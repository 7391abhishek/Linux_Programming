REGISTERS (PRESENCE AND THEIR USES)

MAR: Memory Address Register
	Specifies the address in Memory for the next read and write.
MBR: Memory buffer register
	Points to a memory buffer address, from/which, the data is read or written to.

Similarly , IO registers: IO(AR/BR)
IO module: data transfer between IO devices - processor/memory.
IO module contains buffers to hold data, until can be sent.


Program Status Word: Set of registers used by the processor.
The PSW typically
contains condition codes plus other status information, such as an interrupt
enable/disable bit and a kernel/user mode bit.


In a processor with multiple types of interrupts, a set of registers, called interrupt registers
are present.

Also dedicated registers are used by memory mgt. h/w and other many h/w.
If the h/w is designed with OS support in mind, then some functionality like memory protection
can be implemented in h/w.
