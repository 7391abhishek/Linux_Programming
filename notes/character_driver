Charecter Driver:
. device in linux kernel is represented as a file.
. file in kernel space means an open file and not a file on the disk.
. an open file is represented using a inode structure.

Registering a charecter driver:
For the kernel to recognise your device and perform operations on your behalf,
we need to first introduce our device to the kernel, which is done using the "register_chrdev" method.

Problem: Assignment of a major number for the device file.
Solution-1: Assign a major number manually.
	The issue with selecting this approach is that we never know if the number we selected
	is already being used or it will be used in the future. There is NO GOOD WAY of assigning 
	a major number to your device manually. Thus we use the second solution.

Solution-2: Have the kernel assign a major number dynamically, by passing 0 as the major number as argument
		to "register_chrdev".
	.problem : cant make a device file in advance.
	.sol: let the kernel print the major number, and then user can read that and make the file.
	.sol: the new device will have entry in /proc/devices, read from there and make device.
	.SOL: let kernel issue the mknod, and rm calls for you and, create and delete the device
		files for the user on open and cleanup respectively.
