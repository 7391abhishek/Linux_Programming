Tools to load/remove a kernel module: depmod, insmod, modprobe, rmmod

/etc/modprobe.conf : contains mappings between alias names and actual kernel modules.
/lib/modules/version/modules.dep : file to check dependencies for a particular module. (created using "depmod -a")


***
1. insmod is intended to be fairly dumb about the location of modules, whereas modprobe is aware of the default
location of modules, knows how to figure out the dependencies and load the modules in the right order.

2. .modinfo : additional info about the kernel module 

/proc/kallsyms: Contains the functions/symbols that the kernel has exported for the users to write kernel modules.
Symbols: are resolved while insmoding


Major and Minor Numbers:
	Major Number: tells which driver is used to control this device. Each driver is assigned a unique major number.
	Minor Number: used by the driver to distinguish between various devices it controls.

Types of devices: Character, Block and Network.
Important lines (from The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide):
	The difference is that block devices
	have a buffer for requests, so they can choose the best order in which to respond to the requests. This is
	important in the case of storage devices, where it's faster to read or write sectors which are close to each other,
	rather than those which are further apart. Another difference is that block devices can only accept input and
	return output in blocks (whose size can vary according to the device), whereas character devices are allowed
	to use as many or as few bytes as they like. Most devices in the world are character, because they don't need
	this type of buffering, and they don't operate with a fixed block size.
